## 🎯 Overview
Managing a hostel involves coordinating multiple aspects: room allocation, guest registration, payment tracking, maintenance requests, and facility bookings. Traditional paper-based or spreadsheet systems are inefficient, error-prone, and difficult to scale.

### The Challenge:
- Manual guest registration is time-consuming
- Room availability tracking is complicated
- Payment records get lost or mismanaged
- Maintenance requests are not tracked properly
- Communication between staff and guests is inefficient
- Reporting and analytics are difficult to generate

### The Solution: 
- Instant digital check-in/check-out process
- Real-time room availability tracking
- Automated payment processing and receipt generation
- Centralized maintenance request management
- Direct communication channels between staff and residents
- Comprehensive analytics dashboard for administrators

The app serves three primary user types:

1️⃣ **Administrators:** Full system access and management capabilities

2️⃣ **Staff Members:** Day-to-day operations management

3️⃣ **Guests/Residents:** Self-service portal for bookings and requests
